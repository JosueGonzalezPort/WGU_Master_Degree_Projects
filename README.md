# WGU Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my work in the MS Data Analysis (MSDA) degree programs at Western Governors University. I completed my education to make a career change into data science, and this portfolio showcases that work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in those programs. I benefitted tremendously from the tips and advice of prior students throughout my educational journey, and this is a part of my ongoing issue to return the favor and ensure more people get up the ladder that I've finished climbing.

Classes, Projects, Presentations, and Reviews
The below table contains all of the work performed for my MSDA (graduating in december 2024) and my capstone for my BSDMDA (graduated Jun 2022). Employers will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Summary" links to get descriptions of a class, its requisite projects, and summaries of how I completed them, including links to those materials.
